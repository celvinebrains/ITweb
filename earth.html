		<h1>History Of the Earth</h1>
		<br>The history of Earth covers approximately 4 billion years (4,567,000,000 years), from Earthâ€™s formation out of the solar nebula to the present.
		<br>Earth formed as part of the birth of the solar system: what eventually became the solar system initially existed as a large, rotating cloud of dust and gas.
		<br>It was composed of hydrogen and helium produced in the Big Bang, as well as heavier elements produced by stars long gone.
